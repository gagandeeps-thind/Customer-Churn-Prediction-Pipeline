# Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline
Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a Canadian telecom to predict customer churn, achieving an AUC of 0.92 (92%) on the test set. Implemented data ingestion and processing on Azure Databricks (free tier) to handle 70,000+ customer records, and engineered new features (e.g. contract duration trends, support call frequency) that improved model performance by ~8%. The final model (a Gradient Boosted Trees classifier) was deployed using Azure Machine Learning services. Extensive exploratory data analysis identified key churn drivers, aligning with research that advanced feature engineering can boost telecom churn models (AUC ~93% in industry tests). This project demonstrates scalable data pipeline skills and cloud-based ML deployment in a big-data environment.
